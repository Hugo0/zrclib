## Defiant Pool

Defiant pool is a feature that separates the pool's state from the public funds that are locked within it. The output is that the deposit funds for every transaction is held in a different address making it more difficult to censor via address. This makes it difficult to isolate all the addresses that comprise of the protocol as the address count grows with every deposit.

Future iteration can use recursion proving systems to prove in zero knowledge to the state contract that a deposit has been deployed. Depositors can then broadcast events that are only decypherable via threshold network. This would mean that getting a list of deposit addresses would be impossible making the protocol unsancitionable.
